Introduction:
Heart disease is a prevalent and potentially life-threatening health condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and risk prediction play a crucial role in preventing and managing heart diseases effectively. Logistic regression, a statistical method, has proven to be a valuable tool in predicting the likelihood of binary outcomes, making it suitable for heart disease prediction.

Logistic Regression in Heart Disease Prediction:
Logistic regression is a predictive modeling technique used when the dependent variable is binary. In the context of heart disease prediction, the outcome is often binary, representing the presence or absence of the disease. Logistic regression analyzes the relationship between one or more independent variables and the probability of the outcome occurring.

Variables in Heart Disease Prediction:

Age: Age is a significant risk factor for heart disease, and logistic regression can assess its impact on predicting the likelihood of developing the condition.

Gender: Research has shown that gender can influence heart disease risk. Logistic regression helps quantify this relationship, providing insights into the differing risk levels between men and women.

Cholesterol Levels: Elevated cholesterol levels are associated with an increased risk of heart disease. Logistic regression allows for the assessment of how cholesterol levels contribute to the likelihood of developing heart disease.

Blood Pressure: High blood pressure is a well-established risk factor for heart disease. Logistic regression can analyze the relationship between blood pressure readings and the probability of heart disease.

Smoking Habits: Smoking is a modifiable risk factor for heart disease. Logistic regression helps quantify the impact of smoking on the likelihood of developing heart disease.

Diabetes: Individuals with diabetes are at a higher risk of heart disease. Logistic regression can assess the contribution of diabetes as a predictor in the model.

Benefits of Logistic Regression in Heart Disease Prediction:

Interpretability: Logistic regression provides interpretable results, allowing healthcare professionals to understand the contribution of each variable in predicting heart disease risk.

Prediction Accuracy: Logistic regression is a robust method for binary classification tasks, making it effective in accurately predicting the presence or absence of heart disease.

Risk Stratification: By utilizing logistic regression, healthcare providers can stratify patients into different risk groups, enabling personalized interventions and targeted preventive measures.

Data set:
The dataset come from Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which conducts annual telephone surveys to gather data on the health status of the dataset of US residents with 319794 rows and 12 columns.

Logistic Regression:
Logistic Regression is a statistical algorithm for binary classification.
Utilizes the Logistic/Sigmoid function to estimate the probability of an input belonging to a class.
The Logistic function, also known as the Sigmoid function, is a mathematical function that maps any input value to an output value between 0 and 1.
Decision boundary at 0.5 threshold enables classification into two distinct classes using calculated probabilities.	
The formula for the logistic function is  ùêü(ùê±)=  ùüè/(ùüè+ùêû^(‚àíùê±) )
Where ‚Äòe‚Äô is the base of the natural logarithm, and ‚Äòx‚Äô is the input value.
